## Testing GitHub Copilot

### GitHub Copilot

I saw this video and trust that Cassidy would not have used that many puns if she did not think this was good. [Live demo: GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSbv-1KGu2U?si=ldvDJUmUkx2khDn1)

CS can fine tune AI to the point that it should work well for personal projects.

I'm not concerned with its general use in large organizations or scalability. I am tesing now to determine if I should adjust my own practices for coding.

Being able to specify context using _Spaces_ and their availablity in _GitHub Free_ is one factor supporting this usage of my time.

I have also seen AI explain code I have written in clear language. If nothing else, using AI to refresh my memory about an old project is valuable.
