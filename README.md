## Testing GitHub Copilot

### GitHub Copilot

I saw this video and trust that Cassidy would not have used that many puns if she did not think this was good. [Live demo: GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSbv-1KGu2U?si=ldvDJUmUkx2khDn1)

CS can fine tune AI to the point that it should work well for personal projects.

I'm not concerned with its general use in large organizations or scalability. I am tesing now to determine if I should adjust my own practices for coding.

Being able to specify context using _Spaces_ and their availablity in _GitHub Free_ is one factor supporting this usage of my time.

I have also seen AI explain code I have written in clear language. If nothing else, using AI to refresh my memory about an old project is valuable.

Grouping code to keep like sections together adds comments and makes choices about grouping. This is easier. It reduces decision making in somewhat arbitrary groupings. As long as the choices made make sense this is a lot of effort removed from coding. Will need to find an effective way to see a list of arbitrary choices made.

Easy to use git. Will have to try with a fine tooth comb on a personal project.

I was able to follow the agent (not agentic) coding tutorial and have the system build a running React app. I have never used React before. I'm not certain I have even visitied the website. I have heard people talking about it.
